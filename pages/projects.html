    <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This is where I share the projects I've built while learning and growing as a developer. From small
        experiments to more complex applications, each project represents a step in my coding journey. It's not
        always perfect, but it's real progress one line of code at a time. Take a look and see how far I've
        come!</p>
